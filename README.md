# [Produce_Classification](https://github.com/veerak2/Produce_Classification)
* Built a CNN classifier that classifies images of Produce using not only their images but also their weights.
* Collected over 50 images of each produce with varying backgrounds, also collected the weights of these produce..
* Organised this data on google drive by dividing each class(produce) into their own train and test directories
* Used opencv to read these images and assigned weights to these produce.
* Created a CNN model which accepts weights as auxillary inputs. 

# [Factors influencing Homicides in the United States](https://github.com/veerak2/OLS_Regression/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20Project%20Paper.pdf)
* Collected supplementary homicide data from the Murder accountability project repository.
* Gathered yearly data for each state from FBI, SAMHSA, ATF, US Census etc for our potential independant variables which can explain the homicides in the US.
* Consolidated this data and analysed it using R.
* Built a regression model to identify the important factors.

# [Classifying courses based on transcipts from YouTube](https://github.com/veerak2/LSTM_SiameseNetwork)
* Collected transcripts from YouTube for video submissions made by students.
* Removed stop words from these trascripts, tokenized these words and created word embeddings.
* Trained these words using the gensim model.
* Created a twin dataset with the vectorized transcripts and the target variable indicating whether the transcipts are for the same course.
* Created a siamese LSTM model and used the Manhattan distance to calculate the similarity index.
